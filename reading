for browser.getcurrenturl

If you observe, when the protractor test cases runs, it shows dots in the command line
the number of dots determines the number of 'it' blocks i.e the specs you have written. 
--
> In our spec file, we have loaded the page before each of the 'it' block and got the
first comment element.
> When you carefully observe while protractor is running, after the comment is clicked the first 'it'
block runs
> then again it goes back to the main page ('localhost:3000/')
> and again navigates to Suggestions page and goes back to main page.

now we have defiend our test specs, and all runs successfully, but it takes some time
sy Ex: in our case 5 seconds.
> But if we have larger application it takes longer time, so to avoid long running and ending up
with nothing, we divide our test files with suites in config file
exports.config = {
    specs: ['./e2e/**/*.js'] 
    suites: {
        smoke: './e2e/smoke/**/*.spec.js',
        full: './e2e/**/*.spec.js',
        other: './e2e/**/long.running.spec.js'
    }
};
> Now to tell protractor whihc kind of specs you need to run
protractor suite=smoke
    -- if you want to run only spec files whih are under 'smoke' folder

protractor conf.js --suite=smoke,other
    different suites can be seperated by commas and can be tested
