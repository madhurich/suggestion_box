for browser.getcurrenturl

If you observe, when the protractor test cases runs, it shows dots in the command line
the number of dots determines the number of 'it' blocks i.e the specs you have written. 
--
> In our spec file, we have loaded the page before each of the 'it' block and got the
first comment element.
> When you carefully observe while protractor is running, after the comment is clicked the first 'it'
block runs
> then again it goes back to the main page ('localhost:3000/')
> and again navigates to Suggestions page and goes back to main page.

now we have defiend our test specs, and all runs successfully, but it takes some time
sy Ex: in our case 5 seconds.
> But if we have larger application it takes longer time, so to avoid long running and ending up
with nothing, we divide our test files with suites in config file
exports.config = {
    specs: ['./e2e/**/*.js'] 
    suites: {
        smoke: './e2e/smoke/**/*.spec.js',
        full: './e2e/**/*.spec.js',
        other: './e2e/**/long.running.spec.js'
    }
};
> Now to tell protractor whihc kind of specs you need to run
protractor suite=smoke
    -- if you want to run only spec files whih are under 'smoke' folder

protractor conf.js --suite=smoke,other
    different suites can be seperated by commas and can be tested

TO INSTALL JAVA ON WINDOWS 
> Head on to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
> click accept agrrement -> choose windows 64 bit the last option available
> download and install it on your machine
> after successfull installation
> to check if its installed
> open command prompt
> run 
    javac
     //javac means java compiler
> If it gives you bash command not found, then you need to set environment variable
> For that first head on to
    C:\Program Files\Java
> You can see two folders jdk..some version and jre..some version
> Go to 
    Control Panel\System and Security\System -> advanced system settings 
> a window opens with advanced tab opened, 
> go to environment variables at  the bottom
> wihtin system variables in the second panel wihtin environment varibales
    window, select -> path -> Edit -> in the next window click Edit text
> Now wihtih the existing text, put a semicolon
> Copy the jdk folder path  
    C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_131
> and paste it after the semicolon
> after pasting put a semi colon again
> now copy jre path 
    C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_131
> paste it after the second semicolon you put
> click ok -> ok -> ok till all the windows goes away.
> now open the terminal
> run 
    javac
> it gives you list of commands, now java is installed with java compiler

TO INSTALL JAVA ON MAC
> head on to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
> accept the license, click on MAC OSX the .dmg file 
> run and install it on MAC
> After it gives the succesfull installation message
> close it
> top left apple symbol -> system preferences -> 
> at the bottom you can see java icon
> click on it Java control panel opens up
> within that click on java tab -> view
> you can see that java is installed in that specific location
> now open the terminal , top right corner search for terminal open it
> run javac or javac -version if it gives nothing then java compiler is not installed
> Now you need to set the JAVA HOME environment variable for it
> go to terminal -> wihtin home directory (cd ~/)
> run 
    echo $JAVA_HOME
> if it gives nothing then you need to set the environment varibale
> touch .bash_profile
    creates afile named .bash_profile
> run  
    open -e .bash_profile
> opens the file in edit mode, copy and paste these in that file -> export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
> save and close, open a new terminal 
    run -> echo $JAVA_HOME
    now you can see the location of environment variable is set and java jdk and jre is installed with home, env variable
